# open_alert_viewer

A server and network alert client that will be able to display active alerts on
your Android phone or Linux desktop, with the opportunity for wider support in
the future.

Currently this project is under development, with the goal of building an MVP
and incrementally growing the number of compatible back end alerting services.
